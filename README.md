# PHP-Breathe-Demo

Trying to set up Breathe, Doxygen and Sphinx for PHP

## Documentation

Build documentation with:

```shell
cd docs
make html
```

The results will be in docs/_build/html/

Documentation is built through Doxygen. The Doxygen XML files are parsed by Sphinx using the Breathe extension.
